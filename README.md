# Overview

This project is a basic functional calculator built in C++ that supports arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows users to perform multiple operations in a single session until they choose to exit.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Functional programming:
  - Separate functions for each operation.
- User-friendly:
  - Supports continuous calculations with a `while` loop.
  - Handles invalid operators and division by zero gracefully.

# Future Work

- Add support for more operations, such as:
  - Modulus (%)
  - Exponentiation (^)
- Enhance input validation to handle invalid data types (e.g., non-numeric input).
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
